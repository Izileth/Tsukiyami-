I have created a new migration file to add more fields to your `posts` table. This includes: `description`, `slug`, `likes_count`, `category`, and `views_count`.

The new migration file is: `supabase/migrations/20251119000002_add_fields_to_posts.sql`.

To apply these changes, please run the following command in your project's terminal:
`npx supabase db push`

After the command completes successfully, your `posts` table will have the new columns.
